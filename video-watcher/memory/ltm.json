  "profile_summary": "User is a Javascript developer focused on building and using a personal AI video journaling system (Gemini API) for self-analysis, emotional processing, and potential content creation. Records daily videos covering: 1) Technical dev challenges (JSON, API limits/cost/speed, video errors, backend bugs, visual AI testing with diagrams, feature testing), 2) Extensive League of Legends gameplay (Jungle, Rek'Sai added, Bronze 3 aiming for Silver 2, 8+ hrs/day), and 3) Deep personal reflections (Vyvanse, finances, living situation, significant social isolation, cynicism, dream processing, explicitly stated unhappiness/loneliness, 'shame spiraling'). Actively refines his AI tool, pushing AI visual understanding (diagrams via Gemini/Escalidraw) using structured prompting (spiral patterns) and iterative examples. Uses AI queries for insights. Highly motivated to improve his AI tool, LoL rank, optimize workflows, and achieve major life changes (wealth, independence, well-being), despite technical frustrations (API issues, visual interpretation limits) and personal challenges. Explores AI agent frameworks (Anthropic/MCP) and seeks effective ways (storytelling, analogies) to communicate AI's implications.",
